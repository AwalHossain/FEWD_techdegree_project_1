                Hi, I’m Awal. I'm a multi-talented human with over 10+ years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines.
                            
            </p>
            <p>
                
You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title.

            </p>
            

            <p>I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.</p>
			<p>
                
My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
			
            </p>
            <p>
              
I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is ENTJ</p>
<p>
    . I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.
